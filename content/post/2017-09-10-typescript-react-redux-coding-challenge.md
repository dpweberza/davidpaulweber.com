## Preamble
I have started cleaning up and updating my Github account [https://github.com/dpweberza](https://github.com/dpweberza) as more and more companies these days are likely to view it.
Because I don't have many open-source projects, I have uploaded a rather meaty coding challenge that I completed back in 2015.

## The Coding Challenge
In 2015 I interviewed at a global mobile payments company for the position of Android Developer.
At the time I had no commericial Android development experience but nevertheless was invited to complete a coding challenge after I had passed a screening call.

The challenge story was slightly non-sensical as it involved a user entering in a cash amount to pay for their existing account balance on a mobile app and then being displayed a breakdown of any change to be returned.
This required me to build both a backend API and an android app, which I think is quite a big ask for a job application. However I love to code and loathe white-board coding so I took up the challenge and was excited to build both these elements from scratch.

I completed the project over a weekend, went for a final interview on-site where after going through my code and design decisions with the team lead and architect, I was offered the job.

In the end I remained at my then-current employer but atleast I had the following neat projects for my portfolio.



### Lessons Learnt
1. There are so many ways to go about doing things in React, with the community vary rarely agreeing on best practice. I wasted far too much time looking for the "best" way to handle styling, whether it be pre-processor vs no pre-processor, component stylesheets vs global stylesheets, css-in-js vs css modules, etc.
2. TypeScript, type safety is great but when outdated / broken typing files waste your time
